# Thinkful - String Drills. Repeater (7 kyu)

https://www.codewars.com/kata/thinkful-string-drills-repeater/train/rust

Write a class function named `repeat()` that takes two arguments (a string and a long integer), and returns a new string where the input string is repeated that many times. For example:

```js
Repeater.repeat('a', 5);
```

should return

```js
'aaaaa';
```
