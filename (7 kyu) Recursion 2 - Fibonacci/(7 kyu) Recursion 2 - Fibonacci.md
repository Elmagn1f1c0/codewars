## 2 - Fibonacci number

In mathematical terms, the sequence `f(n)` of [fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

```js
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
```

with seed values

```js
f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 1
```

## Your task

You have to create the function fibonacci that receives n and returns `f(n)`. You have to use recursion.
