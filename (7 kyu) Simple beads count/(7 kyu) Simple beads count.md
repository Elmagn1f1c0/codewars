Two red beads are placed between every two blue beads. There are N blue beads. After looking at the arrangement below work out the number of red beads.

_@_ @@ _@_ @@ _@_ @@ _@_ @@ _@_ @@ _@_

Implement `count_red_beads(n)` (in PHP `count_red_beads($n)`; in Java, Javascript, C, C++ `countRedBeads(n)`) so that it returns the number of _red_ beads.
If there are less than 2 blue beads return 0.
