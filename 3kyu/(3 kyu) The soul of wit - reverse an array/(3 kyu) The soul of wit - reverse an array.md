# The soul of wit: reverse an array (3 kyu)

https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-soul-of-wit-reverse-an-array

No time for stories. Reverse an array, return the result. Do whatever you want with the original array. Don't use Array.prototype.reverse. You have 30 bytes to spare.

```
Example: [1, 2, 3] â†’ [3, 2, 1]
```
