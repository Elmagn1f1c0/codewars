Write a method that takes a number and returns a string of that number in English.

For example:

```
numberToEnglish(27) // => 'twenty seven'
```

Your method should be able to handle any number between 0 and 99999. If given numbers outside of that range or non-Integer numbers, the method should return an empty string.
